                        I am a Software Engineer with 2 years of professional experience working on critical large-scale
                        software. Currently, I work on a back-end payments routing and data transformation
                        application that processes hundreds of transactions per second, totaling ~$4T USD globally per day.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Before I started my Computer Science degree, I was a freelancer offering services to eCommerce
                        stores, from front-end code development to platform migrations and digital ads â€“ and at one
                        point co-founded an online brand that reached {">50k"} active community members before we sold it in
                        2020.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Outside of code, I like to mountain bike (competed at a national level for some time),
                        dirt-bike, off-road in my Jeep, and make craft cocktails.
